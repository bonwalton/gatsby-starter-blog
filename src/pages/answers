**Q5: Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.**

[MailChimp’s API documentation](http://developer.mailchimp.com/) is a great example of a well-organized combo of developer reference and support documentation. I appreciate their interactive Playground and that their guides are both fun to read and give a helpful understanding of APIs in general—not just MailChimp. Additionally, their easy to find Error Glossary, Changelog, and API Status pages are valuable for troubleshooting issues. 

While MailChimp isn’t listed, I think this [blog from Adam at Zapier](https://zapier.com/engineering/great-documentation-examples/) does a great job outlining what makes great API documentation and what to strive for when creating your own documentation.
